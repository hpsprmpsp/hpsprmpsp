significance of doctype (quirk mode : when doctype is not mentioned, browser thinks it as old fashoined and used quirk mode, else standard mode) 2/5
significance of meta 1/5

explain bind, call, apply with example https://medium.com/@omergoldberg/javascript-call-apply-and-bind-e5c27301f7bb 
1/5

create obj x={
    a: val,
    fn : function(){return this.a};
}

var ams = function(){console.log("assa" + this.fn();)}
instead of apssing argument in ams, and using it as arg.fn(), ams.bind(x), will set this as x

call and apply are bind that excepts more parameter
call expects indivisual arguement, apply expects them in array
so for above

ams.call(x,'as',lol')
ams.apply(x, ['as','lol'])
var person = {
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}
var person1 = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe",
}
var person2 = {
  firstName:"Mary",
  lastName: "Doe",
}
person.fullName.call(person1);

what is the recomendation of position of style and script, and why?: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6625843/6853800 
0.5/5

replicate 
for( i = start; i<end; i += step){
    console.log(i);
}
using without any loop, 


Ans:
function looping(start, end , step){
    if(start >= end ){
        return false;
    }
    console.log(start);
    start += step;
    looping(start, end, step)
}

what is the output of
for(var i=0; i< 10; i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
    console.log(i);
},10);

if he gives correct answers ask him why and how shall we solve it(using let) and closure    0/5
